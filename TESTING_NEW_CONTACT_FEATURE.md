FROM tasks t 
JOIN task_contacts tc ON t.id = tc.task_id 
JOIN contacts c ON tc.contact_id = c.id 
WHERE c.id = 42;

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "New Contact" doesn't appear
**Solution:** Check that `entityType === 'contact'` (not 'lead')

### Issue: Account field is not pre-filled
**Solution:** Verify `accountId` prop is passed from parent component

### Issue: Contact not automatically selected
**Solution:** Check `onContactCreated` callback is wired correctly

### Issue: Modal doesn't close after creation
**Solution:** Verify mutation `onSuccess` calls `onClose()`
