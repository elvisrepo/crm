    "### Final, Refined Problem Statement (Version 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing#instructions\n",
    "**For:** The web agency's project, sales, and support teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who are trying to:** Seamlessly manage the entire client lifecycleâ€”from initial lead generation and project execution to recurring payments and ongoing support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But are struggling because:** They rely on a patchwork of disconnected systems and manual processes. Critical information is fragmented across spreadsheets, email threads, generic project management tools, and personal notes, with no single, reliable source of truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This fundamental lack of a central system leads to severe negative impacts across the business:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Team members waste significant time searching multiple locations for client information, leading to duplicated effort and reduced productivity.\n",
    "*   **Lost Revenue Opportunities:** Without a clear, unified view of the sales pipeline, promising leads are not followed up on in a timely manner, resulting in lost deals.\n",
    "*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Information quickly becomes outdated or contradictory across different systems, leading to embarrassing errors and poor decision-making.\n",
    "*   **Poor Strategic Visibility:** It is nearly impossible to get an accurate, real-time overview of the sales pipeline, project status, or client support load, making forecasting and resource planning difficult.\n",
    "*   **Revenue Leakage & Poor Cash Flow:** Tracking recurring retainer payments is difficult and prone to error, leading to missed or delayed invoices and unpredictable cash flow.\n",
    "*   **Inconsistent Client Service:** With no standard process for logging and handling requests, the client experience can be inconsistent, potentially damaging the agency's reputation and client satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ultimately, this operational chaos places a hard cap on the agency's ability to grow. As the number of clients increases, these problems compound, making it impossible to scale the business effectively.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Business Goals the CRM Solves:**\n",
    "    *   **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce time spent searching for information and managing administrative tasks by centralizing all client, project, support, and payment data.\n",
    "    *   **Improve Client Management:** Gain a 360-degree view of each client (contact info, project history, support tickets, payment status) to provide more informed and consistent service.\n",
    "    *   **Streamline Sales Process:** Effectively track leads from initial contact through to becoming a client (Account/Contact) and starting a project (Opportunity). Ensure timely follow-ups.\n",
    "    *   **Enhance Project/Task Tracking:** Manage the sales pipeline (Opportunities) and track non-project client work like support requests and maintenance tasks (Cases) systematically.\n",
    "    *   **Stabilize Revenue Tracking:** Easily log and monitor monthly retainer payments, quickly identifying overdue accounts.\n",
    "    *   **Provide Foundational Scalability:** Implement a system that can support the agency's current needs and grow with it, ensuring consistent processes even with more clients or team members.\n",
    "    *   **Enable Basic Reporting:** Gain insights into the sales pipeline, common support issues, and client payment statuses to make better business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, the \"Why\" is to move from scattered, inefficient, and potentially error-prone manual processes to a centralized, streamlined, and reliable system that improves efficiency, client service, and revenue management for the web agency.**"
