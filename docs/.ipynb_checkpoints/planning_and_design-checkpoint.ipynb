    "**For:** The web agency's project, sales, and support teams.\n",

    "**Who are trying to:** Seamlessly manage the entire client lifecycle—from initial lead generation and project execution to recurring payments and ongoing support.\n",

    "\n",
    "**This fundamental lack of a central system leads to severe negative impacts across the business:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Team members waste significant time searching multiple locations for client information, leading to duplicated effort and reduced productivity.\n",
    "*   **Lost Revenue Opportunities:** Without a clear, unified view of the sales pipeline, promising leads are not followed up on in a timely manner, resulting in lost deals.\n",
    "*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Information quickly becomes outdated or contradictory across different systems, leading to embarrassing errors and poor decision-making.\n",
    "*   **Poor Strategic Visibility:** It is nearly impossible to get an accurate, real-time overview of the sales pipeline, project status, or client support load, making forecasting and resource planning difficult.\n",
    "*   **Revenue Leakage & Poor Cash Flow:** Tracking recurring retainer payments is difficult and prone to error, leading to missed or delayed invoices and unpredictable cash flow.\n",
    "*   **Inconsistent Client Service:** With no standard process for logging and handling requests, the client experience can be inconsistent, potentially damaging the agency's reputation and client satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ultimately, this operational chaos places a hard cap on the agency's ability to grow. As the number of clients increases, these problems compound, making it impossible to scale the business effectively.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Business Goals the CRM Solves:**\n",
    "    *   **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce time spent searching for information and managing administrative tasks by centralizing all client, project, support, and payment data.\n",
    "    *   **Improve Client Management:** Gain a 360-degree view of each client (contact info, project history, support tickets, payment status) to provide more informed and consistent service.\n",
    "    *   **Streamline Sales Process:** Effectively track leads from initial contact through to becoming a client (Account/Contact) and starting a project (Opportunity). Ensure timely follow-ups.\n",
    "    *   **Enhance Project/Task Tracking:** Manage the sales pipeline (Opportunities) and track non-project client work like support requests and maintenance tasks (Cases) systematically.\n",
    "    *   **Stabilize Revenue Tracking:** Easily log and monitor monthly retainer payments, quickly identifying overdue accounts.\n",
    "    *   **Provide Foundational Scalability:** Implement a system that can support the agency's current needs and grow with it, ensuring consistent processes even with more clients or team members.\n",
    "    *   **Enable Basic Reporting:** Gain insights into the sales pipeline, common support issues, and client payment statuses to make better business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, the \"Why\" is to move from scattered, inefficient, and potentially error-prone manual processes to a centralized, streamlined, and reliable system that improves efficiency, client service, and revenue management for the web agency.**"

    "## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n",
    "\n",
    "These requirements define the quality attributes and operational standards of the CRM system. They are critical for ensuring the application is reliable, secure, and fit for its purpose as a core business tool for the web agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Reliability & Durability\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statement:** The system must ensure high data durability and reliability. Core business data (Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) must be persistently stored and protected against loss.\n",
    "*   **Context & Quantification:**\n",
    "    *   Losing client or project data would be significantly detrimental to the agency's operations and reputation.\n",
    "    *   The system **shall** utilize a database with transactional integrity (ACID-compliant), such as PostgreSQL.\n",
    "    *   Regular, automated backups (daily) **shall** be implemented with a **Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of less than 24 hours** (meaning no more than one day's worth of data could be lost in a worst-case scenario).\n",
    "    *   The system **shall** have a **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 4 hours** during business hours, meaning the system can be restored from a backup within that timeframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Security\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statement:** The system must provide robust security to protect sensitive client and agency data from unauthorized access or modification.\n",
    "*   **Context & Quantification:**\n",
    "    *   All user access **shall** be protected by secure authentication, including individual user accounts and strongly hashed passwords (e.g., using bcrypt).\n",
    "    *   Data transmission between the client (browser) and server **shall** be encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS).\n",
    "    *   The system **shall** implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), at a minimum distinguishing between 'Admin' and 'User' roles to control access to sensitive functions like user creation.\n",
    "    *   The application **shall** be built following secure coding practices to mitigate common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10). This includes using framework features for protection against SQL Injection and XSS, and validating all incoming data.\n",
    "    *   A process **shall** be in place for regularly scanning and updating third-party libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Performance & Responsiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statement:** The system must provide a responsive and fluid user experience for all common operations under the expected load of a small team.\n",
    "*   **Context & Quantification:**\n",
    "    *   For a small number of concurrent users (1-5), the following performance targets **should** be met:\n",
    "        *   Loading core list views (Accounts, Contacts, etc.) with up to a few thousand records: **< 3 seconds**.\n",
    "        *   Loading individual record detail views: **< 2 seconds**.\n",
    "        *   Saving or updating a record (from click to user feedback): **< 1.5 seconds**.\n",
    "    *   These performance targets **should** be met through efficient database queries (e.g., proper indexing of foreign keys and frequently filtered columns) rather than complex caching mechanisms for the MVP. Performance profiling will be a post-launch activity if targets are consistently missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statement:** The system must be designed and built in a way that facilitates ongoing maintenance, bug fixing, and future feature development by a solo developer or small team.\n",
    "*   **Context & Quantification:**\n",
    "    *   The codebase **shall** adhere to consistent style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Prettier for JavaScript) and include clear documentation for complex business logic.\n",
    "    *   The architecture **shall** have a clean separation of concerns (frontend React application, backend Django API, PostgreSQL database).\n",
    "    *   The system **shall** be structured to facilitate automated testing (e.g., unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints).\n",
    "    *   All code and configuration **shall** be managed under version control (Git) with a consistent branching strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Operability\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statement:** The system must be operable, providing sufficient visibility into its health and behavior to allow for effective troubleshooting and production management.\n",
    "*   **Context & Quantification:**\n",
    "    *   To enable effective debugging, the backend application **shall** produce structured logs (e.g., JSON format) for key events, especially for errors and handled exceptions.\n",
    "    *   The backend **shall** expose a simple `/api/health` endpoint that can be used to confirm the service is running and can connect to the database.\n",
    "    *   All environment-specific configuration (database credentials, secret keys, etc.) **shall** be managed via environment variables and **must not** be hardcoded in the source code."
