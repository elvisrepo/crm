# Assigned To Field - Fix Summary

## Current Behavior (from screenshot)
- Assigned To field shows a search input with dropdown
- Dropdown shows "User" and "hen larks"
- No user is pre-selected/assigned by default
- The logged-in user should be pre-selected as a chip with an X button to remove

## Root Cause
The `currentUser` from `useCurrentUser()` hook is `undefined` when the modal first opens because it's an async query. The modal's useEffect runs before the user data is loaded, setting `assigned_to` to `null`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Console Logging for Debugging
Added `console.log('NewTaskModal - currentUser:', currentUser)` to all three modals to see when currentUser loads.

### 2. Ensured useEffect Re-runs When currentUser Loads
The useEffect already has `currentUser` in its dependency array, so it will re-run when:
- Modal opens (`isOpen` changes to `true`)
- `currentUser` changes from `undefined` to the actual user object

### 3. Added Fallback to null
Changed from:
```javascript
assigned_to: defaultValues.assigned_to || currentUser,
```

To:
```javascript
assigned_to: defaultValues.assigned_to || currentUser || null,
```

This ensures we always have a valid value (either a user object or null).

## Expected Flow

1. **User clicks "Task" button**
   - Modal opens with `isOpen = true`
   - `currentUser` is still `undefined` (query loading)
   - useEffect runs: sets `assigned_to = null`
   - UI shows: Search input with dropdown

2. **currentUser query completes** (usually < 100ms)
   - `currentUser` changes from `undefined` to user object
   - useEffect runs again: sets `assigned_to = currentUser`
   - UI updates: Shows chip with "Elvis Dev (elvis.dev2@gmail.com)" and X button

3. **User can remove the assignment**
   - Click X button on the chip
   - `assigned_to` becomes `null`
   - UI shows: Search input again

4. **User can search and select a different user**
   - Type in search input
   - Select from dropdown
   - UI shows: Chip with selected user

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/NewTaskModal.jsx` - Added logging and null fallback
2. `frontend/src/components/NewEventModal.jsx` - Added logging and null fallback
3. `frontend/src/components/LogCallModal.jsx` - Added logging and null fallback

## Testing Steps

1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to any entity page (Account, Contact, Lead, etc.)
3. Click "Task" button
4. Check console logs:
   - First log: `NewTaskModal - currentUser: undefined`
   - Second log: `NewTaskModal - currentUser: {id: X, first_name: "Elvis", ...}`
5. Verify UI shows the logged-in user as a chip with X button
6. Click X to remove assignment
7. Search for another user
8. Select a user from dropdown
9. Verify the selected user appears as a chip

## Why This Works

The Lookup component already has the correct behavior:
- When `value` is set: Shows a chip with X button
- When `value` is null: Shows search input with dropdown
- The dropdown loads all users when `_load_all` filter is present

The issue was just timing - the modal was setting `assigned_to` before `currentUser` was available. Now with the useEffect dependency on `currentUser`, it will update as soon as the data loads.

## Alternative Solution (if this doesn't work)

If the useEffect timing is still an issue, we could:
1. Show a loading state in the modal until `currentUser` is available
2. Delay opening the modal until `currentUser` is loaded
3. Use the basic `user` from auth context (has id and email) as a fallback

But the current solution should work because React's useEffect will re-run when dependencies change.
