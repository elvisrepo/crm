# Custom CRM for Web Agency

This project is a full-stack custom CRM application designed for a small web development agency. It aims to solve inefficiencies caused by fragmented data by providing a single, centralized platform for managing leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities, and support cases.

This CRM is being built to solve these specific problems and enable the agency to scale effectively.
